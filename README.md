This project detects manipulated or tampered regions in digital images using Deep Learning.
It employs a ResNet50 architecture integrated with Self-Attention Mechanisms to capture fine-grained inconsistencies in textures and edges.
Trained on the CASIA2 dataset, the model provides accurate and reliable authenticity verification.
